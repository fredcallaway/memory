# Summary

Memory recall is often modeled as a process of evidence accumulation. Existing
models typically assume that this accumulation process is passive, and not
subject to top-down control. In contrast, recent work in perceptual and
value-based decision making has suggested that similar kinds of evidence
accumulation processes are guided by attention, such that evidence for
attended items is accumulated faster than for non-attended items. Furthermore,
attention may be adaptively allocated to different items in order to optimize
a tradeoff between decision quality and the computational cost of evidence
accumulation. In this project, we ask whether similar forces are at play in
the context of memory recall.

Such a model predicts that, when multiple memories are relevant, people will
focus their efforts on recalling the target which is more strongly represented
in memory, because it can be recalled with less effort. Here we present a
simple form of such a model, and test this key prediction in a cued-recall
experiment in which participants can select which of two possible targets to
remember. We find tentative support for a model in which memory search is
guided by partial recall progress in order to minimize the time spent recalling.

# Model

We model memory recall as a process of evidence accumulation. As in the DDM or
LCA, we assume that evidence is sampled at each time step and that recall
occurs when the total evidence hits a threshold. To make the model solvable
(by dynamic programming) we assume that the evidence for each target
follows a Bernoulli distribution
$$
x_t \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p),
$$
where $p$ corresponds to the strength of the memory. This image shows several possible
traces of evidence accumulation for a single item:

```

When multiple memories are relevant, each one has a separate accumulator.
Critically, we do not assume that evidence is sampled for each item in
parallel. Instead, at each time step, a policy selects one of the targets and
accumulates evidence for only that target. Solving the resulting Markov
decision process, we find that the optimal policy generally converges on the
target with maximal memory strength (highest $p$) and only draws samples for
that target until it is recalled. This is illustrated in the following plot:

```

# Experiment

To test the model's predictions, we developed a modified cued-recall experiment in which
participants were presented with two cues (images) on each trial and could recall the target
(word) associated with either one. To create an observable behavioral correlate of targeted
memory search, only one cue is visible at a time and participants use the keyboard to display
each in turn. This is basically a cheap alternative to eye-tracking. The assumption is that
people will look at the image they are currently trying to remember the word for.
See a demo [here](http://memorygame29.herokuapp.com/?test_type=multi-recall&skip=6).


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/task.png")
```

The model predicts that people will spend more time looking at the cue for
which the memory of the corresponding target is stronger. To test this
prediction, we need a way to measure memory strength. Early attempts to
manipulate memorability using established norms were not successful. Thus,
we instead take the approach of measuring the strength of each cue-target
pair in an earlier phase of the experiment. We've tried two strategies.

1. Standard cued recall task: operationalize memory strength
of each pair as the average log reaction time for trials in which the
participant recalled the target (with a fixed penalty for failure trials).
2. Reverse 2AFC task: operationalize memory strength as the average
log reaction time to choose the correct image out of two options, when
presented with the word. Note that we have reversed the role of cue and target
here in order to reduce the likelihood that people develop metacognitive
awareness of which images they know well in this pretest phase.

Overall, the results are stronger using the second approach, so I'll focus
on those. Results with approach 1 can be found
[here](http://fredcallaway.com/reports/memory/simple_then_multi-21-05-13.html).
