w066f11e,everything was clear ,no ,no ,no 
w9ad1c78,They were pretty straightforward. It would have been nice to know that the images and text would only be shown once throughout but I guess wouldn't have changed the outcome too much,nope it worked well,nope ,
wd902f96,No - they made sense.,It was a little bit tricky to respond quickly using the correct keys.,no,

wcf9ea93,,,,Thank you!
w32070eb,"Nothing was confusing, hard to understand, or too long.","No, it was easy to use.",No technical issues.,"This was an interesting survey. However, my short term memory did not respond well with so many images and just seeing them for a few seconds and I found it very hard to do. I thought maybe the quizzes would be multiple choice or having to recall if I saw an image with a word, but it was typing it in and I had a really hard time remembering most of them."
w3b56fcd,"at the last part phrasing it as do not and the other as yes is conmfusing, long sentance plus using do as a negative for unsure is confusing- shortening it helps (got the practicew wrong cause of it) (theres a reason most use absolutely sure vs not sure instead of know it vs do not know)","yeah, the math issue creates bias, 5 seconds to solve problem, find keys on the keyboard then move to enter key on opposite end only to get nothing despite a correct answer just cause enter was too far away? that activly discrimiates against compact keyboards without numpads, when it times out it should stil use the text in the field (not sure if thats part of interface)",,"yeah, the math issue creates bias, 5 seconds to solve problem, find keys on the keyboard then move to enter key on opposite end only to get nothing despite a correct answer just cause enter was too far away? that activly discrimiates against compact keyboards without numpads, when it times out it should still use the text in the field (not sure if thats part of interface so im also including it here)"

w4201c44,they were easy to understand,not at all,no technical issues whatsoever,this was a pretty fun study to do
w15cf0cb,The instructions were clear but there were so many images and names that it was impossible for me to feel like I could keep up. I really only felt like 3 or 4 that I was fully capable of remembering.,It was not difficult. It responded very quickly and I did not encounter any issues with it.,Nope. Everything worked smoothly,
wbfb3c0a,No,Not really,No,
w4ab6536,No,No,No,nope!

w5b510c9,not confusing,no,no,"for the last round, since I got 0/77 right on the previous round I knew I could not remember any of the words. I figure it would be best to go for the time bonus since I did not remember any of the words.  "

w42b00b9,No,No,No,This was fun!
w650469f,"Instructions were pretty clear, but unless I missed something, it could have been more blatant on what to do in the first section when completely unsure of the word. I left a good number blank instead of filling them all in with 2-3 words I knew were used but couldn't remember where.",No problems on that front.,Everything worked well.,Was kind of fun and hoping my leaving things blank instead of spamming window or sky in numerous boxes in the first part doesn't hurt anything.
