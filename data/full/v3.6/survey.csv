2,,,,
3,,,,
4,no,no,no,no
5,The last part was somewhat confusing. It would have been helpful to have which keys to press (view left and right picture) above the task when you were completing it. I forgot the keys a lot of the time.,No it was good.,No,Good study and loved the survey
6,A little but the practice tries helped clarify things so it was not a problem.,"Yes, the final task was a bit cumbersome to use all the different keys as well as using them in the correct order.","I accidentally clicked ""D"" or ""F"" before viewing an image for the final task so I got one try incorrect for that reason. I could not go back and view the image after selecting it. ","Overall, I enjoyed the study. I thought it was interesting and very challenging in a fun way. I would love to do this again or do the memory task for my own enjoyment :)"
7,No,No,No,"i really enjoyed this survey! The math problems were hard to keep up with the timer, it's silly i know"

11,"for the last part it was VERY confusing. especially because my answer were marked as wrong in the beginning, until I realized I was on caps lock",no until the end,"yes, wouldn't take my answers in caps",would loved to be rewarded for my answers in the last part that were marked as incorrect because there were in caps lock

20,They were easy and made sense!,I didn't think so!,Nope!,
21,,,,
22,The instructions weren't confusing and they were the perfect length in my opinion.,"The interface wasn't difficult to use. If it doesn't compromise the integrity of the survey, it might be a good idea to have the keys (D,F,J,K) on screen during the actual experiment, especially for the last round.",I did not experience any technical problems.,The memory game was interesting and I enjoyed participating!
23,the second set of instructions were slightly confusing the first time they were written out,nope,nope,nope
24,No.,No.,No.,
25,"They were a little tricky to understand at first, but the practice rounds were helpful. ",,,"It's interesting how it wasn't only a picture-word association but also using the brain and muscle memory in some ways as well. The final test, using D,F,J,K keys was somewhat difficult but interesting. "
26,,,,
27,too long,yes,no,less questions next time
28,"Nope, all made sense","The j/k and d/f part was a bit tricky, I pressed the wrong button once. For one of them I pressed j to view the left and accidentally pressed f to view the right, but then I was stuck entering for the right image even though I'd never seen it before. It would be nice if you could go back if you mess up.",,
