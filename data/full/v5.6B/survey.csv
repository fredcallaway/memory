0,It felt a little long,No,No,
1,"no, they were fine","no, it worked well",everything worked fine,That was hard!
2,No.,No.,No.,I think I got one wrong in the final test because I put a space at the end which seems harsh if that was the case. Not that I expect you to prove me right or wrong personally as I noticed it quickly but I'm more thinking that if what I thought I saw is true then someone might've done much worse because of it. My apologies if this is false and I've just seen something wrong.
3,no the instructions were clear,no,no,no
4,no,no,no,
5,easy to understand,easy to use,no,no
6,I did find the last task a bit hard to understand and thought it was a bit cruel only having one practise round.,"Yes, in the last task. Hard to remember all the keys needed, especially since you have to take your hands off them to type the world. I miss clicked because of this.",,
7,,,,
8,no,no,no,
9,no,no,no,
10,,,,
11,The main instructions weren't confusing but I found the final task quite confusing because it started without me realising and so I started with answering the pairing from the practise round. Also I didn't know if you got the answer wrong if it then changed the pairing or it would stay there until you answered it correctly. I got used to it but that was the only part of the instructions I struggled with.,"No, it was very clear and easy to use",No I did not experience any technical problems,That study was challenging and quite fun. I'm always surprised with how much you can begin to recognise and answer the pairings without really thinking once you've seen them a few times. Thank you!

Realizing again what I already knew, that people are able to remember things better through quick associations they make in their mind.  It's definitely something I should practice more.  Good study.  Thank you."

354,No,No,No,Only one on the last task I accidentally clicked F before I had looked at the images. I then couldn't look at them because one was already selected to answer

395,"The last task key press instructions were  confusing. As a result, I performed very poorly.",Please see above :),I messaged you about images not displaying on final task but actually think the key presses were confusing me - would have appreciated more practice rounds to get used to how this worked before starting final task.,I hope you accept my submission even though the last task key presses confused me but if you would like me to return it then please let me know. Thank you. 
396,,,,
397,yes - more time needed to explain the use of keys in the last task,,,

I always thought I had a good memory! It was fun and fast, which I enjoyed. Thank you and good luck with your research."
399,"no, okay once I got the hang of it",the df and jd keys were confusing. the mouse might have been easier,I pressed the d key a couple of times instead of j and so the image did not display and there was no way back,No account for minor spelling errors/typos when the word was correct.
400,I needed a reminder re the instructions for the 2 pictures together. ,no,no,
401,no,no,no,"yes, the maths questions were impossible, no time to even read it let alone write the answer so i gave up."

412,I read them twice but no problem.,No,No,No
413,The last round seemed needlessly hard. I trialled and errored for a bit,"Again, round 3, it would be easier to view with D,F and submit with J,K (left to right, step 1, step 2)",no,"would be nice to see an average score, calculated in real time, to see how I fared"
414,no the instructions were very good,no very straightforward,no,
415,No,No,No,I'm not sure what the aim of this study is maybe you could get people to recite the words instead of typing them out as I'm dyspraxic and dyslexic and timed out now and again because I was making sure that I'd spelt a word correctly. 
416,There were nothing confusing or hard to understand anyway.,Not at all.,N/A,

436,,,,This was a fun study. Thank you.

438,,,,
439,"no, relatively straight forward to understand",no,no,no
440,The instructions were clear.,No,No,
441,No.  ,Yes.  For the reason below.  My memory skills are terrible but the last task was most frustrating as my selection would change for some reason when I went to type in the box.,The last task was difficult as the one I selected would change when I went to put the word in sometimes.,My memory is not what it used to be.
442,The instructions were clear except for part 3 where you asked for each selection to be shown twice which I may or may not have done and then it wasn't clear when the practice stopped and the exercise began,Using 4 keys for part 3 was a bit confusing and felt pressured even though had more time,No,None
443,very easy to understand,no,no,no
444,,,,
445,quite long,no,no,
446,"the insructions were fine for me, no ambiguity and sufficient information. Except maybe that you could explain that the answers are case sensitive, I typed an answer with a capital first letter, (habit), and it said it was wrong, even though it was one of the answers I was pretty sure about, though there may have been another typo of course.","the only difficulty was the use of the J & K and D & D keys at the end, as it is timed and you need to take your finger off the keys to type if you aren't a touch typist, (and an accurate one), you are likely to lose a lot of time  repositioning your fingers and/or hit the wrong key.",None,"I was amazed at how many I thought I could remember after the second run through of the images, I tried to make up a mini phrase or story and I guess the reinforcement of the second run through really did work. I have issues remembering things and mild aphasia since I had a 'collapse/seizure'? doing this study has really given me a great deal of hope! Thanks for the confidence boost. Oh and I can't do maths, not even simple sums like those, not in that amount of time, and never have been able to!"

451,"for the last task it was a bit confusing, the practice didn't seem to match up with the real task as the box just appeared for me to type in.",not too bad,no,"I'm sure i got some of them correct, such as parsley for the desert island, but it said i was incorrect and i'm wondering if it's because autocorrect put a capital or a space after it? sure i got some typo's too, but don't get a bonus for those"

465,No it was easy to understand,It was simple to use,no technical difficulties,
466,a little confusing. I would have preferred to have a shorter practice round with different pictures to start because in the first round I felt like I didn't know what I was doing,not really,no,

Thank you."
479,Some of the instructions were confusing and not clear enough to understand.,,For the last task the answer box was not working properly and I had to press on random keys multiple times.,
480,the last task was very hard to complete- it would only let me type a couple of times,as above,no,no

486,They were suitable,"the D, F and J, K a bit confusing at times",no,it was fun
487,No issues,"I think for the final test it might have been better to either leave a reminder of which buttons showed the image, or forced you to click on the image rather than pressing a button, since I sometimes accidentally clicked D or F first and wasn't able to see the images, so had to make a guess.",No issues,
488,"The instructions were pretty simple, but I read them carefully more than once for the longer ones in the final section to be sure I understood. ",No,No,This was fun!

498,no,no,no,interesting
499,no,no,no,no
500,The instructions were ok.,Interface was not difficult to use.,Images all displayed well.,None
501,No.,No.,Yes. The last exercise is case sensitive (and perhaps previous ones too). That's a bit harsh. I capitalised the initial letter of my answers but they were consistently coming up as incorrect... I thought maybe it might be a study where you were trying to knock my confidence by giving negative feedback or something. Then it occurred to me not to capitalise the initial letter... and I started getting told my answers were correct!,You need to review the results (and the rewards) due to the case sensitivity problem I identified above (and maybe give me a bonus for taking the time to tell you all this!)

659,I thought the last - final test - was very confusing. Having to switch between J/K and then D/F was tricky and slowed me down.,No (but see above),No,I cannot remember the word for the sea-image (with the starfish) and it's driving me crazy.
660,,,,"I found it quite easy to memorise the word if I found something in the picture I could associate it to, for example imagining the river flowing into a pocket, or the plane blowing spaghetti out the engine. I think I also got 79 out of 80 in the second trial, but the one incorrect was a typo as I was trying to go as fast as possible, which was a bit of a bummer, I like a perfect score!"
661,You should have kept the keys needed on display for the entire final round,no,no,This was far too hard for me and I struggled to remember more than 2 or 3. Far too many to remember.

672,Too long,No,Slow at displaying,No
673,not really apart from the last bit with the 2 pictures,no,no,"fun study, frustrating not to be abl to remember many of the combinations"
674,I did have to concentrate to understand what you meant initially but after the first round I'd cottoned on,No not all,No,"Clearly I need to do some brain training!  My memory is awful!  Thank you, really enjoyed that!"
675,no,no,nothing,
676,"Noe, they were simple.",No,"Yes, some images in round 2 didn't load or were sticking.",All the best with the results.
