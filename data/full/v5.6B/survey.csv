wf1e76ec,It felt a little long,No,No,
w0a28cf4,"no, they were fine","no, it worked well",everything worked fine,That was hard!
w1e27c75,No.,No.,No.,I think I got one wrong in the final test because I put a space at the end which seems harsh if that was the case. Not that I expect you to prove me right or wrong personally as I noticed it quickly but I'm more thinking that if what I thought I saw is true then someone might've done much worse because of it. My apologies if this is false and I've just seen something wrong.

we9a3929,I did find the last task a bit hard to understand and thought it was a bit cruel only having one practise round.,"Yes, in the last task. Hard to remember all the keys needed, especially since you have to take your hands off them to type the world. I miss clicked because of this.",,

web5b5b4,no,no,no,
w86d65f2,,,,
w2f58008,The main instructions weren't confusing but I found the final task quite confusing because it started without me realising and so I started with answering the pairing from the practise round. Also I didn't know if you got the answer wrong if it then changed the pairing or it would stay there until you answered it correctly. I got used to it but that was the only part of the instructions I struggled with.,"No, it was very clear and easy to use",No I did not experience any technical problems,That study was challenging and quite fun. I'm always surprised with how much you can begin to recognise and answer the pairings without really thinking once you've seen them a few times. Thank you!

w615f46c,The instructions were clear except for part 3 where you asked for each selection to be shown twice which I may or may not have done and then it wasn't clear when the practice stopped and the exercise began,Using 4 keys for part 3 was a bit confusing and felt pressured even though had more time,No,None

Except maybe that you could explain that the answers are case sensitive, I typed an answer with a capital first letter, (habit), and it said it was wrong, even though it was one of the answers I was pretty sure about, though there may have been another typo of course.","the only difficulty was the use of the J & K and D & D keys at the end, as it is timed and you need to take your finger off the keys to type if you aren't a touch typist, (and an accurate one), you are likely to lose a lot of time  repositioning your fingers and/or hit the wrong key.",None,"I was amazed at how many I thought I could remember after the second run through of the images, I tried to make up a mini phrase or story and I guess the reinforcement of the second run through really did work.

w26fdc77,No.,No.,Yes. The last exercise is case sensitive (and perhaps previous ones too). That's a bit harsh. I capitalised the initial letter of my answers but they were consistently coming up as incorrect... I thought maybe it might be a study where you were trying to knock my confidence by giving negative feedback or something. Then it occurred to me not to capitalise the initial letter... and I started getting told my answers were correct!,You need to review the results (and the rewards) due to the case sensitivity problem I identified above (and maybe give me a bonus for taking the time to tell you all this!)

wc664155,No,I hit F to early once but that was really my fault,No,
w427bcb0,"They were not hard to understand but i could not remember the other letter to take me to the right hand side box to type the answer in so i could only remember the letter D that took me to the left hand box to type in my answer, therefore the ones i remembered in the tests before this one...i got them wrong because they was not in the correct box.","It was not difficult to see, it was very clear.","Yes, but i think that was because i was typing in D before J or K to see which box would light up for my answer to go in, and i was clicking on the letters next to D but that only resulted in the letters appearing in the box!!",I was frustrated as i thought that i could remember more than what i did then when some of the images came on my mind was blank.

wd8d29f7,No they were fine,no,none,A really interesting survey
wb2fea0a,"The instructions for the final section were very confusing.    to flip from left to right using the J & K keys was straightforward but not the answering.     I understood i selected D and typed the correct word for J, but even though i was 100% sure i was correct, i got incorrect every time",No,NO,The instructions on the last section should have been repeated each screen

w034bfcb,No,No,No,No
wc21d158,I didn't know that I was not supposed to add capital letters to the start of a word. I kept getting them wrong until I stopped doing that. (e.g. cape not Cape),"No, I understand the last part was supposed to be harder, so the confusion I had at first was fine. ",No.,
wf6527de,No,"I don't think so, but see below.","YES! On the last round with the choice of photos, in practically every case the box failed to appear, making it impossible to enter the answer!",No.
w05baf25,No,"Yes.  The maths test was impossibky fast for soemone like me who is in her 60s and doesn't touch type.  Getting the answer was easy but there wasn't enough time to look down, locate the right keys on the keybpoard, type the answer and press enter, especially when the answer had 2 digits (one more keypress).",No,Not really
w6e892e8,,"It was mostly very good. I got a little muddled with the order of the DF and JK buttons in the last task - it might have been better to use the left and right arrows instead of JK, as this feels more intuitive.",,

w0d079c6,The instructions were easy to understand. ,No. ,No,Fun survey!
w74870a8,,the last tasks buttons seemed unintuitive. I would have assumed using J and k to select the images then simply using enter or space to select the one currently highlighted. Definitely misclicked 3-4 times by accident,Some images did not display at all,
w064dc5c,they were easy,It would be nice if the prompts stayed on the screen so u can remember its DF and JK ,No,it was quite tricky

we03d16a,I thought the last - final test - was very confusing. Having to switch between J/K and then D/F was tricky and slowed me down.,No (but see above),No,I cannot remember the word for the sea-image (with the starfish) and it's driving me crazy.
w7f59609,,,,"I found it quite easy to memorise the word if I found something in the picture I could associate it to, for example imagining the river flowing into a pocket, or the plane blowing spaghetti out the engine. I think I also got 79 out of 80 in the second trial, but the one incorrect was a typo as I was trying to go as fast as possible, which was a bit of a bummer, I like a perfect score!"
w4385e0c,You should have kept the keys needed on display for the entire final round,no,no,This was far too hard for me and I struggled to remember more than 2 or 3. Far too many to remember.

w694d13b,not really apart from the last bit with the 2 pictures,no,no,"fun study, frustrating not to be abl to remember many of the combinations"
w6541c50,I did have to concentrate to understand what you meant initially but after the first round I'd cottoned on,No not all,No,"Clearly I need to do some brain training!  My memory is awful!  Thank you, really enjoyed that!"
