377,"no, they were perfect",no,no,no
378,Clear,No,No,None
379,"Not confusing at all, easy to understand.","The interface was easy to use. Maybe for the third part include what the J, K, D and F keys mean in the corner for a user that did not read instructions clearly though.",No technical problems.,Nope

395,"Not confusing at all, easy to follow",I think the last part where you used the letter on the right to change the pictures and then the letters on the left to choose was more difficult because we are used to going from left to right.
