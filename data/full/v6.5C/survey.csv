w3f98fed,,,,,"there was no way to account for typos, where the word is essentially correct, just misspelled. I felt there needed to be more time to look at the image/word to be able to even stand a chance at association. The words didn't really stand out significantly against the background image, either, so it felt like you were looking at a blurred word cut out of the image."

wfcbcfb3,Not sure? They were green and red? Not sure what's being asked,"I think at the beginning it would be helpful to know that we were going to be shown pictures and then asked what word related to it. I tried to memorize words and pictures as if the question would be ""what word/picture never showed up"" insteading of coming up with relationships between the two unrelated things (i.e. use your ear to listen to the loud city). but then again this ambiguity might have been an integral part of the experiment",,,
w988c978,No did not notice,No,No,No,None
w2ebd75a,They were a different color.,No,No,No,
w1eeb2d1,"No, I did not see any letters flashing!",No,No,No,"This was fun.  I remember doing a study that was slightly similar, but that one had you keep going through untill you got the pairs right.  I think the words that went with the pictures were made up words, or possibly foreign words."
w61b0ebd,no,no,no,no,"I'm really sorry I tried to remember but the way I studied them I said outloud twice the word then a word to remember the image, but I ended up only remembering the word that I chose for the image "
w95f8186,No,No,No,No,No
w337b4e3,no,no,no,no,
w3edf426,not at all,they were slightly confusing on what you would earn more money on and not,no not at all,nope,
w96a13ca,I did not notice that there were letters at all. Were there supposed to be letters? I only saw the numbers 9indicating payment) and whether or not I got the question right (green CORRECT or red INCORRECT and -1 cent).,Instructions were great,No difficulty at all,No technical problems,Thanks for an interesting survey! I had a fun time trying to memorize all the words.
