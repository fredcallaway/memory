w9e4dd03,Not at all,It was fine,I did not,My memory isn't what it once was
w7e03059,Everything was perfect and easy to understand. ,Not difficult. The only issue I had was my screen was maybe too small and I had to scroll down every time a new image appeared so I could see the entire thing and not just the bottom of it. Even during the tests. Maybe it's because I zoomed in on the page to make the image a little larger.,All images displayed just fine. Only issue was what I wrote above about having to scroll to see each image instead of it just being in the middle of my screen. Had that not happened I wouldn't have been a little distracted and would have gotten more correct.,"This was super fun! I always think I have a horrible memory but it's nice to see that I can actually remember things when I try. It was fun trying to put the words to the pictures with word association methods. I envisioned myself eating cake in that museum and doing puzzles in the restaurant. And dipping my ear in the pool. I realized the one I was putting ""drink"" for was supposed to be horse I think (I was thinking the horse was getting a drink at that water and focused on drink instead of horse). Thanks! :)"

w76f82d2,Nope! Very clear and easy to understand.,"No, everything was clean and simple.",Experienced no issues.,
wae94e88,I didn't like that we were only shown one the words with images once and it wasn't just a few at a time and then tested on them. It was all thrown at once and made it really difficult for me to really pick up on any of them. It wasn't clear that I would only be shown them once.,Interface itself is easy to understand and use.,Nope,
