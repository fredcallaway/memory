we6c90c7,No,No everything clear and good,no,No,"no, thanks"
w7b2b827,They were all related to at least one of the pictures,No,No,No,"For the first round of images, I didn't actively try any techniques to memorize them. For the second round, I tried to memorize the word association by creating a scenario. For example ""using the TOILET on the PLANE"" or ""a LION on the MOUNTAIN"". Some were harder to memorize than others, like ""fence"" with the photo of the stream (I imagined someone fenced in their private forest or something). Also, on the last round with the images flashing, I remembered most of the word associations from the second round but elected to type in the word associated most closely with a photo because it was easier not to mess it up (which I learned after typing 'dune' because the word flashed when i meant 'sand' on the picture of the solar panel)."
w9c68907,no,the last section was long ,no,no,none
w464acd4,I didn't notice ,I thought that the instructions were good,No,No,
wa68f594,Yes - the words that flashed on the screen were a hint to one of the answers.,"No, however, switching back and forth between the keys in the time limit was a bit stressful.","The space bar was not super intuitive, but it was not difficult.",No,"I realized very early on that the words flashing on screen were a hint to the answer. However, I didn't rely on those heavily to answer the question in the last round, as I remembered the pairs well. Given the time limit, I either chose the image that I viewed first, or the word that was faster to type, since using the various keys to flip back and forth was a bit time consuming and stressful."

web1332e,They related to at least one of the images,Nope,Nope,Nope,"Interesting study, and a bit fun too!"
w90c80d8,some seem to be hints to the answers.  I'm guessing the ones that were not were a hint to the other photo.  I only looked at the second photo once,"No.  Had to pay attention, but no.","uhm, I'm not a great keyboard guy so the whole J-K / D-F was a bit.  But no",no,Fun.
