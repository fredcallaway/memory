wb4faa62,I did not,The instructions seemed very clear to me.,The interface was ok.,I could not use my numpad on the math section so I do feel a little cheated but I probably only got half of them in time.,The math portion could be just a second or two slower or even have a pause in between each equation. It took me until the very last question to even notice my numpad didn't work.
